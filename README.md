Replace the contents of config/database.yml with the following:

```
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  host: db
  username: postgres
  password: password
  pool: 5

development:
  <<: *default
  database: docker-rails_development


test:
  <<: *default
  database: docker-rails_test
```

Now that youâ€™ve got a new Gemfile, you need to build the image, run.

```
$ docker compose up --build
```

```
$ docker compose run web rake db:create
```

When finished, fell free to delete `previews` folder, this is not necessary.

Based on this [Documentation](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/official-documentation-samples/rails/).
